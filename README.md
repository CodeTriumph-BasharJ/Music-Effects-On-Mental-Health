This project analyses the effects of music on the mental health of a set of unique individuals who have different tastes in music. The goal of the study is to determine which genre tends to be the most 
effective in reducing the symptoms of mental health problems.
The most effective design for the study was a 3 * 4 matrix of scatter plots to analyze 12 different music genres and compare individual genres with each other within the matrix; furthermore,
the graphs are interactive where clicking the legend category filters between individuals who experienced improved mental health, the ones who haven't, and different genres.

The code also contains different plots that aided in the process of understanding which design is most effective to represent the data as a whole and with minimal compromise to comprehension.
